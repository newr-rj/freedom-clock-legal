        <li>Enhance features based on usage patterns</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Data Sharing with AI Services (Optional)</h3>
    <p>By default, no retirement planning data is shared with external services. If you choose to enable the "Use external AI for answers" feature in Settings:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>What We Share:</strong> Your retirement plan inputs (age, current savings, income, monthly spending, retirement location preferences) and your questions to the AI assistant</li>
        <li><strong>Why We Share:</strong> To provide personalized, context-aware retirement planning advice and answer your specific questions</li>
        <li><strong>Who We Share With:</strong> Perplexity AI and Groq AI services for natural language processing and response generation</li>
        <li><strong>Your Control:</strong> You can enable or disable this feature at any time in Settings. Disabling it stops all data sharing immediately</li>
        <li><strong>Consent Required:</strong> You must explicitly consent before any data is shared. The app will not share data without your permission</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> Your retirement planning data is stored locally on your device</li>
        <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> Data is encrypted at rest using iOS data protection</li>
        <li><strong>No Sale of Data:</strong> We do not sell your personal information to third parties</li>
        <li><strong>Anonymous Analytics:</strong> Analytics data is collected anonymously and cannot identify you personally</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We use the following third-party services:</p>
    <ul>

These services do not retain your data after processing your queries. You can disable this feature at any time in Settings.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These services have their own privacy policies and data practices. You must provide explicit consent before any data is shared with external AI services.</p>

        <li><strong>Analytics Opt-Out:</strong> You can limit analytics collection through your device's privacy settings</li>
        <li><strong>Subscription Management:</strong> Manage or cancel subscriptions through your Apple ID settings</li>
        <li><strong>Revoke AI Consent:</strong> Turn off the AI toggle in Settings to immediately stop sharing data with external AI services</li>
    </ul>
