    <h2>Indemnification</h2>
    <p>You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless FreedomClock, its owners, operators, affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, licensors, and service providers (collectively, "Indemnified Parties") from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs, debts, and expenses (including but not limited to attorney's fees and court costs) arising from or related to:</p>

    <h2>Changes to Terms</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. We will notify you of material changes through the App or by updating the "Last Updated" date. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the new Terms.</p>

    <h2>Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h2>
    
    <h3>Governing Law</h3>
    <p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to its conflict of law principles.</p>

    <h3>Arbitration Agreement</h3>
    <p>Any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the App shall be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to these Terms.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Binding Arbitration:</strong> Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited</li>
        <li><strong>Individual Basis:</strong> You and FreedomClock agree that any arbitration shall be conducted on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated, or representative action</li>
        <li><strong>No Class Actions:</strong> You agree to waive any right to participate in a class action lawsuit or class-wide arbitration</li>
        <li><strong>Costs:</strong> Each party shall bear its own costs of arbitration unless otherwise awarded by the arbitrator</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Jurisdiction and Venue</h3>
    <p>To the extent arbitration does not apply, you agree that any legal action or proceeding shall be brought exclusively in the state or federal courts located in Delaware, and you consent to the personal jurisdiction of such courts.</p>

    <h3>Time Limit for Claims</h3>
    <p>You agree that any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the App or these Terms must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose, or be forever barred.</p>

    <h2>Severability</h2>
    <p>If any provision of these Terms is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions will continue in effect.</p>

    <h2>Entire Agreement</h2>
    <p>These Terms, together with our Privacy Policy, constitute the entire agreement between you and FreedomClock regarding the App and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, whether written or oral.</p>

    <h2>Waiver and Severability</h2>
    <p>No waiver by FreedomClock of any term or condition shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term. If any provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable, that provision shall be struck and the remaining provisions shall be enforced to the fullest extent under law.</p>

    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>You may not assign or transfer these Terms or your rights under these Terms without our prior written consent. We may assign these Terms without restriction. Any attempted assignment in violation of this section shall be void.</p>

    <h2>Force Majeure</h2>
    <p>We shall not be liable for any failure or delay in performance under these Terms due to causes beyond our reasonable control, including but not limited to acts of God, war, terrorism, labor disputes, or internet service provider failures.</p>
